Built an ML pipeline for approval outcome prediction, covering EDA, preprocessing, imbalance handling, model tuning, and evaluation.

# EasyVisa Visa Approval Prediction – Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end **machine learning classification solution** to predict whether a U.S. visa application should be **Certified** or **Denied**.

The goal is to help the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) and EasyVisa **streamline visa processing**, reduce manual review effort, and identify the **key drivers that influence visa approval decisions**.

The solution follows a **clean, structured, production-style ML workflow** and is designed to be easy to explain in interviews and resumes.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Facilitate faster visa approval decisions using data-driven insights
- Identify applicant and employer characteristics that increase approval probability
- Minimize costly **false approvals** by prioritizing **precision** as a key metric

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure (High-Level)
The notebook is organized into **8 clearly defined sections**, each representing a standard step in a real-world ML pipeline.

### **Section 1 – Imports & Configuration**
- Import required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn)
- Set random seeds for reproducibility
- Suppress warnings and define global settings

---

### **Section 2 – Data Loading & Initial Inspection**
- Load the EasyVisa dataset
- Inspect dataset shape, column names, and data types
- Perform basic sanity checks

---

### **Section 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Univariate and bivariate analysis of key features
- Understand approval trends across:
  - Education level
  - Job experience
  - Wage levels
  - Employer size
  - Region of employment
- Identify class imbalance in visa outcomes

---

### **Section 4 – Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale numerical features where required
- Prepare feature matrix (`X`) and target variable (`y`)

---

### **Section 5 – Handling Class Imbalance**
- Analyze imbalance between **Certified** vs **Denied** cases
- Apply:
  - Oversampling techniques
  - Undersampling techniques
- Compare model behavior under different sampling strategies

---

### **Section 6 – Model Training & Evaluation**
Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

> **Precision is prioritized** due to the business impact of false approvals.

---

### **Section 7 – Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Selection**
- Perform hyperparameter tuning on top-performing models
- Compare tuned models on validation performance
- Select the **final best-performing model** based on business metrics

---

### **Section 8 – Final Model Evaluation & Business Insights**
- Evaluate final model on unseen test data
- Interpret feature importance
- Translate ML results into **actionable business insights**

Examples:
- Higher education and prior job experience significantly improve approval chances
- Higher prevailing wages correlate strongly with approvals
- Medium to large employers show better approval rates

---

## 📊 Key Results
- Final model achieved **high precision**, minimizing false approvals
- Model generalized well from validation to test data
- Feature importance provided clear, explainable decision drivers

---
